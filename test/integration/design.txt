Challenge: how to test Dometer connects to nameserver in resolv.conf?

We can backup, replace, and restore /etc/resolv.conf with each integration test,
but this is hacky and smelly. It's fine to do in a self-contained environment,
like a Docker container, but bad news otherwise.

Better: use resolv_wrapper to monkey-patch libresolv.

Components:
 - resolv_wrapper
 - Dometer
 - DNS client

Harness:
 - Configure resolv_wrapper
 - Start/stop Dometer

Test steps:
 - Run query
 - Verify result
